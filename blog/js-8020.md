## Tutorial Series

This is the first of several tutorials that will teach how to build the calculator below with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First, we'll focus on the most 'difficult' part, that is JavaScript, so the basics of this programming language will be covered in this tutorial.

## A different perspective on learning a programming language

For a moment I want you to think that a programming language is no different than a spoken one, if you want to learn Spanish there are several approaches to achieve your goal. You can start by learning all the syntax, grammatical rules and get all on the theory, but as they say: you won't learn to swim until you get in the water.

Other tactic would be to get a full immersion on the languages, start watching movies without subtitles, change your computer and mobile language, etc., the problem with this is that you lack the fundamentals and thus slowing your leaning at the beginning.

I think that a better approach is to mix the best of both worlds and apply the Pareto Principle (20% of the input produces 80% of the output). This means learning just enough syntax and start applying that knowledge right away.

Also, I want you to notice that with a language syntax and grammar you can create different products, I mean if you learn Spanish well enough you can start writing poems, essays, novels, etc., all these creations are very different from each other, but share the same rules dictated by the language.

The above is also true for JavaScript, you can use it in different environments (the browser, a server, or as a JavaScript library) but at the end, they will all follow the same syntactical rules, to exemplify the latter let's take a look at three different pieces of code:

### Browser

```javascript
const document = window.document;
document.querySelectAll("h1");
```

### Node Runtime Environment (server)

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.mkdir("/user/Desktop/myNewDirectory");
```

### JavaScript Library

```javascript
const _ = require("lodash");

_.tail([1, 2, 3]);
```

It's ok if you don't understand any of the code above, but take a look at the patterns that are presented:

The `const` keyword, an arbitrary word (or character), then an equal sign and finally the meaning this word will have, followed by a semicolon.

What we did in the first line is called variable declaration (we'll have a deeper explanation in the sections below).

In the second line we use the declared variable followed by a `.`, after that there's another word that contains something inside parenthesis.

To better understand what's going on, let's get some theory.

## JavaScript Basics

### Variables

In programming, we use something called **variables** to store **data** with a specific name in the computer's memory, later we can access the data by calling the name of the variable.

JavaScript, has three different keywords to tell the computer we are about to declare a variable, these are:

- `var`
- `let`
- `const`

To declare a variable, you would have to type any of these followed by the name of the variable, an equal sign `=` and finally the value you want to assign to the variable.

**Example**

```javascript
var myString = "Hello World!";

let myNumber = 5;

const secondsInMinute = 60;
```

_Note: It's important to clarify that the `=` doesn't mean that our variable has been equalized to the value, rather than the value has been assigned to it._

Now you may be wondering what are the differences between the three keywords.

`var` was used in JavaScript before more modern syntax was implemented to the language and it brought a lot of trouble when programming. The problems `var` might bring are out of the scope of this tutorial, but will be addressed in future tutorials, so for now, we will avoid its usage.

`let` is used when you want to declare a variable in which the assigned value will **change** in the future, and therefore be reassigned.

`const` is used when you want a variable's value to be constant and to keep its initial **data type**, preventing from reassigning the value.

_Note: data types are the types of values that can be stored within a varible, we'll cover them in the next section_

### Data Types

As we learned in the previous section, we can store values inside variables, but what kind of values exist in JavaScript?

They are divided into two main groups:

- Primitives or Value Types
- Reference Types

#### Primitive types

**String**

Consider this as plain text. For JavaScript to recognize a string you have wrap the text in double quotes `"your text"` or simple quotes `'your text'`, what you choose doesn't affect JavaScript's abilty to identify a string.

```javascript
const myString = "Hello World";
```

**Number**

It is any number, including numbers with decimals. Unlike strings, you don't need any wrapper for the value, you just type it. If you wrap a number in quotes it will be treated as a string and not as the numeric value it represents.

```javascript
const myNumber = 5;
const myOtherNumber = 6.789:
const notANumber = '10';
```

**Boolean**

This as a binary value, a boolean can only be a `true` or `false`.

```javascript
const amILearning = true;
const isThisBoring = false;
```

**undefined**

This data type, is the way of the computer to tell you that you have a varible which contains no value or that you are trying to access an undeclared variable.

**null**

It does the same as `undefined`, that is representing the absence of a value, but with the big difference that this type of data is the way we tell the computer that we want to have no value.

#### Reference Types

**Object**
The object, is a collection of elements that are listed in key, value format. Think of it as a variable that can store other varibles in a directory-like structure. They key would act as a variable name, and the value is just, well, the value. You can store any of the previous data types we saw inside an object key, including other objects.

```javascript
const myObject = {
  myString: "This is my value",
  myNum: 5,
  isInsideAnObject: true,
  nestedObject: {
    isNested: true
  }
};
```

**Arrays**
It is an unordered collection of any data types.

```javascript
const myList = [1, "hello", {}];
```

**Functions**

This is a contained block of code that can be called multiple times and performs a specific task.

```javascript
function addNums(numOne, numTwo) {
  return numOne + numTwo;
}

const sumOne = addNums(3, 4); //sumOne would have the value of 7
const sumTwo = addNums(4, 10); //sumOne would have the value of 14
```

Down below we have a section explaining functions in depth.

### Object Literals In Depth

Objects are highly used in the development world, this is because they're the base of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm (OOP). A paradigm is nothing but a programming style. In the specific case of OOP, the core is that any element of the real world can be abstracted as an object. Let's take the example of a car. A car has a model, a brand, a motor type, etc.. This characteristics can be represented in code in this way:

```javascript
const myCar = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  model: 2019,
  motorType: "electric",
  batteryLevel: 100
};
```

Each ones of the declared 'variables' inside an object are called **properties**. This means that our object has four properties: brand, model, motorType, and batteryLevel. Also, it is important to say that each key-value couple has to be separated by a comma `,`.

If we want to access to our object properties, we can do it with the dot notation `.`. This means that we have to use the name of our object, followed by a dot, and the name of the property we want to access.

```javascript
// If we want to know the bran of our car, we have
// to write the following:
console.log(myCar.brand); // This command will print in console the string "Tesla"
```

The objects can hold functions too, this functions are called methods. Lets create a method that turns on the car:

```javascript
const myCar = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  model: 2019,
  motorType: "electric",
  batteryLevel: 100,
  turnOn() {
    console.log("Car turned on");
  }
};
```

Just the same way as the properties, the methods can be called by the dot notation, so if we want to run our `turnOn` method, we have to do the following:

```javascript
myCar.turnOn(); // This will print to console "Car turned on"
```

### Functions In Depth

As we previously saw, functions are isolated blocks of code that executes specific tasks.

Just as variables, we have to notify JavaScript that we are declaring a function using the keyword `function`, followed by the function name, a parenthesis `()` and finally curly braces `{}` in which we will keep the code we want to execute.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  // Here will be the code that will be executed
}
```

Another important aspect of functions, is that they may need to use some external data. If this is the case, we need to declare the data that this function will need inside the parenthesis.

```javascript
function myFunction(externalData) {
  // Here will be the code that will be executed
}
```

The functions can receive _n_ amount of external data. The correct name of this data is **parameter**. The name of the parameters works as a placeholder, and can hold any name. Think in the parameters as the text that appears in some forms inside the input in gray color. This just works as a reference of which value we need to send to the function, or which value to use in the input.

![Placeholder example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2014/05/03/label-placeholder-captions.png)

```javascript
function myFunction(paramOne, paramTwo, paramThree, paramFour) {
  // Here will be the code that will be executed
}
```

With the previous information, lets build a function that add two numbers:

```javascript
function addNumbers(numberOne, numberTwo) {
  numberOne + numberTwo;
}
```

This function will add the two number values inside the function, but this value won't be usable outside the function, it will be lost.

For being able to use the calculated value outside the function, we need to return that value as the function result. For this, we will use the reserved word `return`.

```javascript
function addNumbersV2(numberOne, numberTwo) {
  return numberOne + numberTwo;
}
```

With this, everytime the function is executed, we will be able to use the value.

```javascript
console.log(addNumbers(1 + 2)); // Will print: undefined
console.log(addNumbersV2(1 + 2)); // Will print: 3
```

As we previously saw, in the specific case of the objects, you must not use the reserved keyword `function`. This is because JavaScript is able to detect by itself that it is a function.

```javascript
const myCar = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  model: 2019,
  motorType: "electric",
  batteryLevel: 100,
  turnOn() {
    console.log("Car turned on");
  }
};
```

As we can see, in the declaration of the previous object, `turnOn` is a function that is declared inside the same object. For executing it, you only need to do:

```javascript
myCar.turnOn(); // "Car turned on"
```

## Wrap Up

With all what we learned here, we can have a better understanding of what is happening in the first examples.

### Browser

```javascript
const document = window.document;
document.querySelectAll("h1");
```

### Node Runtime Environment (server)

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.mkdir("/user/Desktop/myNewDirectory");
```

### JavaScript Library

```javascript
const _ = require("lodash");

_.tail([1, 2, 3]);
```

In the server, as in the JavaScript library, we are using the function `require` that receives as a parameter a string, and we are assigning the value this function returns to a variable. In the second line, we realize that the value inside the variable is an object that contains the methods `mkdir` and `tail` respectively.

In the browser case, we are accessing the `document` property of the `window` object and assigning it to a variable named `document`. Then, `document` is a object too that contains a function called `querySelectAll` that receives as an argument a string. In the next tutorial we will see deeper what is the `document` object, waht is it for, and what we can achieve using it.
