## Tutorial Series

This is the first of several tutorials that will teach how to build the calculator below with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First, we'll focus on the most 'difficult' part, that is JavaScript, so the basics of this programming language will be covered in this tutorial.

## A different perspective on learning a programming language

For a moment I want you to think that a programming language is no different than a spoken one, if you want to learn Spanish there are several approaches to achieve your goal. You can start by learning all the syntax, grammatical rules and get all on the theory, but as they say: you won't learn to swim until you get in the water.

Other tactic would be to get a full immersion on the languages, start watching movies without subtitles, change your computer and mobile language, etc., the problem with this is that you lack the fundamentals and thus slowing your leaning at the beginning.

I think that a better approach is to mix the best of both worlds and apply the Pareto Principle (20% of the input produces 80% of the output). This means learning just enough syntax and start applying that knowledge right away.

Also, I want you to notice that with a language syntax and grammar you can create different products, I mean if you learn Spanish well enough you can start writing poems, essays, novels, etc., all these creations are very different from each other, but share the same rules dictated by the language.

The above is also true for JavaScript, you can use it in different environments (the browser, a server, or as a JavaScript library) but at the end, they will all follow the same syntactical rules, to exemplify the latter let's take a look at three different pieces of code:

### Browser

```javascript
const document = window.document;
document.querySelectAll("h1");
```

### Node Runtime Environment (server)

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.mkdir("/user/Desktop/myNewDirectory");
```

### JavaScript Library

```javascript
const _ = require("lodash");

_.tail([1, 2, 3]);
```

It's ok if you don't understand any of the code above, but take a look at the patterns that are presented:

The `const` keyword, an arbitrary word (or symbol), then an equal sign and finally the meaning this word will have, followed by a semicolon.

What we did in the first line is called variable declaration (we'll have a deeper explanation in the sections below).

In the second line we use the declared variable followed by a `.`, after that there's another word that contains something inside parenthesis.

To better understand what's going on, let's get some theory.

## JavaScript Basics

### Variables

In programming, we use something called **variables** to store **data** with a specific name in the computer's memory, later we can access the data by calling the name of the variable.

JavaScript, has three different keywords to tell the computer we are about to declare a variable, these are:

- `var`
- `let`
- `const`

To declare a variable, you would have to type any of these followed by the name of the variable, an equal sign `=` and finally the value you want to assign to the variable.

**Example**

```javascript
var myString = "Hello World!";

let myNumber = 5;

const secondsInMinute = 60;
```

_Note: It's important to clarify that the `=` doesn't mean that our variable has been equalized to the value, rather than the value has been assigned to it._

Now you may be wondering what are the differences between the three keywords.

`var` was used in JavaScript before more modern syntax was implemented to the language and it brought a lot of trouble when programming. The problems `var` might bring are out of the scope of this tutorial, but will be addressed in future tutorials, so for now, we will avoid its usage.

`let` is used when you want to declare a variable in which the assigned value will change its data type in the future.

`const` is used when you want a variable to keep its initial data type.

### Data Types

Data types refer to all the different types of values we can save in a variable. The main types are strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries/objects, functions.

The string is any text we would want to save

```javascript
const myString = "Hello World";
```

The object, or dictionary, is a collection of elements that are listed in key, value format. Just think in a normal dictionary, each word has a meaning, so if you would like the meaning of a specific word, you would have to look for it.

```javascript
const myObject = {
  hello: "Hello World"
};
```

The number type is literally any number (obviously it has constraints depending on the computer resources)

```javascript
const myNumber = 5;
```

The list is a unordered collection of any type of variables

```javascript
    const myList = [1, "hello", {}, ðŸ˜„];
```

### Object Literals

### Functions

This is an isolated block of code that can be called multiple times. Think of functions as the traditional mathematic ones, that have one input and one output. For example, think of the following function:

```
f(x) = 2x
```

this function defines that every input `x` will be multiplied by 2, and will be returned as output. For example, if we define 4 as input, it will be like the following:

```javascript
f(x)=2x

f(4) = 2(4) = 8
```

so if we pay attention, each function has an input, a processing, and an output. It's the same in the programming world:

```javascript
    function(input){
    	// some processing
    	return processedInput
    }
```
